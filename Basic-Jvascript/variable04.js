// In this <commit-M> we are going to study about JavaScript Variables

// Javascript Varibable: Variables are used to store data in JavaScript.
//Variables are used to store reusable values.The values of the variables are allocated using the assignment operator(“=”). 
// Variable can store the information
// We can use that information later or chnage that information later

// assignment operator: The assignment operator = assigns the value of its right-hand operand to a variable, a property, or an indexer element given by its left-hand operand. The result of an assignment expression is the value assigned to the left-hand operand.

// variable name are case sensitive used them same as you defined in your code file other it will give your error

// "use Strict";

// declare variable
// use variable
// chnage Value
